                        The BMW E28 is the second generation of BMW 5 Series mid-size sedans, and was produced from 1981 to 1988. It replaced the E12 and was initially produced with petrol 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines.

                        The E28 was the first 5 Series with the centre console angled towards the driver and the option of anti-lock brakes (ABS). In 1983, a diesel engine was available for the first time in a 5 Series.
                        
                        The E28 was replaced by the E34 in 1988.
                            
                        The first BMW M5 was produced during the E28 generation. It was powered by the S38B35 and the M88/3 straight-six engines.

                        BMW offered all their engines for the E28. These were the petrol engines M10, M20, M30 as well as their sport versions and the diesel engine M21. The M20, M21 and M30 are all fuel-injected straight-six engines. The M20 and M30 petrol engines have a multipoint fuel injection system, while the diesel M21 engines have indirect fuel-injection.

                        The only engine to use a carburettor is the four-cylinder M10 used in the 518, which is fitted with a Pierburg 2B4 carburettor. The slightly inclined engine is mounted on the front axle bracket and screwed to the gearbox.
