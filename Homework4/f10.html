                        The BMW F10/F11/F07/F18 is the sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was produced from 2010 to 2017.[9][10] The body styles of the range are:

                        4-door sedan/saloon (F10)
                        5-door estate/wagon (F11, marketed as "Touring")
                        5-door fastback (F07, marketed as "Gran Turismo")
                        4-door long wheelbase sedan (F18, sold only in China, Mexico and the Middle East)
                        The F07 Gran Turismo is the first 5 Series to be available in a fastback body style. The F10 is also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch transmission (in the M5), active rear-wheel steering (called "Integral Active Steering"), electric power steering, double wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called "Black Panel Display") and automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant").[11]
                            
                        In February 2017, the F10 was replaced by the G30 5 Series.[12]
                            
                        The F10 M5 is powered by the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It is the first M5 to use a turbocharged engine.

                        The F10 uses a more traditional BMW exterior styling approach compared with the controversial styling of its E60 predecessor. [29] The "Bangle butt" is removed,[30] a Hofmeister kink is present,[31] a traditional kidney grill is used and crease lines are used on the bonnet 
                        (similar to the E39 and older 5 Series models).[32] Reviews of the styling have ranged from slightly bland, to handsome and muscular.[29][31][33][34][35]

                        The interior features an updated iDrive system[36] and a 13 mm (0.5 in) increase in rear knee-room for rear passengers.[31] The F10 saw the return of the centre console being angled towards the driver,[37][38] as used on the E39 and earlier generations of 5 Series.
